# Customer Churn Prediction 🚀

This project predicts **customer churn** using machine learning. Churn prediction helps businesses retain customers by identifying those likely to leave.

## 📌 Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature engineering ,feature selection)
- Machine learning model (K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes,Support Vector Machine (SVM),Decision Tree (DT).)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,ROC-AUC Score)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
